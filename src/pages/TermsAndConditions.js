          These Terms and Conditions (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) are a binding legal

          When used in these Terms, &ldquo;Uganda Bookings,&rdquo;

        <p>
          The Uganda Bookings Platform offers an online venue that enables users
          (&ldquo;Members&rdquo;) to publish, offer, search for, and book
          services. Members who publish and offer services are
          &ldquo;Hosts&rdquo; and Members who search for, book, or use services
          are &ldquo;Guests.&rdquo; Hosts offer accommodations
          (&ldquo;Accommodations&rdquo;), activities, excursions, and events
          (&ldquo;Experiences&rdquo;), and a variety of travel and other
          services (collectively, &ldquo;Host Services,&rdquo; and each Host
          Service offering, a &ldquo;Listing&rdquo;). You must register an
          account to access and use many features of the Uganda Bookings
          Platform, and must keep your account information accurate. As the
          provider of the Uganda Bookings Platform, Uganda Bookings does not
          own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. Uganda
          Bookings is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between
          Hosts and Guests, nor is Uganda Bookings a real estate broker, travel
          agency, or insurer. Uganda Bookings is not acting as an agent in any
          capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of
          Service (&ldquo;Payment Terms&rdquo;).
        </p>
        <p>
          We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like
          our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal
          data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services
          provided to Members by the Uganda Bookings payment entities.If you are
          a Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all
          laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply
          to your Host Services.

            &nbsp;a. We take reasonable care in providing our Platform, but we
            can&rsquo;t guarantee that everything on it is accurate (we get
            information from the Service Providers). To the extent permitted by
            law, we can&rsquo;t be held responsible for any errors, any
            interruptions, or any missing bits of information - although we will
            do everything we can to correct/fix them as soon as we can.&nbsp;

            5. Limitation of liability
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          a.To the extent permitted by mandatory consumer law, we&rsquo;ll only
          be liable for costs you incur as a direct result of a failure on our
          behalf. This means, to the extent permitted by law, we won&rsquo;t be
          liable for (e.g.) any:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>indirect loss or indirect damage</li>
          <li>inaccurate information about a Service Provider</li>
          <li>
            product, service or action of a Service Provider or other business
            partner
          </li>
          <li>
            mistake in an email address, phone number or credit card number
            (unless it&rsquo;s our fault)
          </li>
          <li>force majeure or event beyond our control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          b. If you are in breach of these Terms and/or the Service
          Provider&rsquo;s terms, to the extent permitted by law:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            we won&rsquo;t be liable for any costs you incur as a result, and
          </li>
          <li>you won&rsquo;t be entitled to any refund.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          c. To the extent permitted by law, the most that we, or any Service
          Provider, will be liable for (whether for one event or a series of
          connected events) is the cost of your Booking, as set out in your
          confirmation email.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Nothing in these terms will limit our (or the Service
          Provider&rsquo;s) liability in respect of our (or their) own (i)
          negligence that leads to death or personal injury or (ii) fraud or
          fraudulent misrepresentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. We don&rsquo;t make any promises about Service Providers&rsquo;
          products and services (apart from what we expressly state in these
          Terms). Making the right choice(s) is entirely your responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. Just to make it clear: nothing in these Terms will entitle any
          third party other than the Service Provider to anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          g. You may be protected by mandatory consumer protection laws and
          regulations, which guarantee you rights that no company&rsquo;s terms
          can overrule. In that case, our liability is determined not just by
          these Terms, but also by any applicable consumer protection laws and
          regulations.
