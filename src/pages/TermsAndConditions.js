          These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement
          between you and Uganda Bookings that govern your right to use the
          websites, applications, and other offerings from Uganda Bookings
          (collectively, the “Uganda Bookings Platform”). When used in these
          Terms, “Uganda Bookings,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the Uganda
          Bookings entity.

        <p>
          The Uganda Bookings Platform offers an online venue that enables users
          (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members
          who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for,
          book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations,
          activities, excursions, events and a variety of travel and other
          services. You must register an account to access and use many features
          of the Uganda Bookings Platform, and must keep your account
          information accurate. <br></br>
          <br></br>As the provider of the Uganda Bookings Platform, Uganda
          Bookings does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host
          Services. Uganda Bookings is not a party to the contracts entered into
          directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Uganda Bookings a real
          estate broker, travel agency, or insurer. Uganda Bookings is not
          acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified
          in the Payments Terms of Service. <br></br>
          <br></br>We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these
          Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use
          of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment
          services provided to Members by the Uganda Bookings payment entities.
          If you are a Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying
          with all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties
          that apply to your Host Services.

            3. More about us.
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          a. When you book an accommodation, flight, rental car or attraction,
          Uganda Bookings provides and is responsible for the Platform but not
          the Travel Experience itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. We work with companies that provide local support services (e.g.
          Customer Support or account management). They don’t:
        </p>
        ● control or manage our Platform <br></br>● have their own Platform{" "}
        <br></br>● have any legal or contractual relationship with you <br></br>
        ● provide Travel Experiences
        <br></br>● represent us, enter into contracts or accept legal documents
        in our name <br></br>● operate as our ‘process or service agents’.

        <p>
          {" "}
          <span>
            a. We take reasonable care in providing our Platform, but we can’t
            guarantee that everything on it is accurate (we get information from
            the Service Providers). To the extent permitted by law, we can’t be
            held responsible for any errors, any interruptions, or any missing
            bits of information - although we will do everything we can to
            correct/fix them as soon as we can. b. Our Platform is not a
            recommendation or endorsement of any Service Provider or its
            products, services, facilities, vehicles, etc.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>c. We’re not a party to the terms between you and the
            Service Provider. The Service Provider is solely responsible for the
            Travel Experience.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>d. To make a Booking, you may need to create an Account.
            Please make sure all your info (including payment and contact
            details) is correct and up to date to avoid inconveniences. You’re
            responsible for anything that happens with your Account, so please
            don’t let anyone else use it, and please keep your username and
            password secret.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>e. We will show you the offers that are available to you.{" "}
            <br></br>
            <br></br>f. Unless otherwise indicated, you need to be at least 18
            to use the Platform.

            5. Limitation of liability
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          a. To the extent permitted by mandatory consumer law, we’ll only be
          liable for costs you incur as a direct result of a failure on our
          behalf. This means, to the extent permitted by law, we won’t be liable
          for:
          <br></br>● indirect loss or indirect damage
          <br></br>● inaccurate information about a Service Provider
          <br></br>● product, service or action of a Service Provider or other
          business partner
          <br></br>● mistake in an email address, phone number or credit card
          number (unless it’s our fault)
          <br></br>● force majeure or event beyond our control.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          b. If you are in breach of these Terms and/or the Service Provider’s
          terms, to the extent permitted by law:
          <br></br>● we won’t be liable for any costs you incur as a result, and
          <br></br>● you won’t be entitled to any refund.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          c. To the extent permitted by law, the most that we, or any Service
          Provider, will be liable for is the cost of your Booking, as set out
          in your confirmation email.
          <br></br>
          d. Nothing in these terms will limit our (or the Service Provider’s)
          liability in respect of our (or their) own (i) negligence that leads
          to death or personal injury or (ii) fraud or fraudulent
          misrepresentation.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          e. We don’t make any promises about Service Providers’ products and
          services (apart from what we expressly state in these Terms). Making
          the right choice(s) is entirely your responsibility.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          f. Just to make it clear: nothing in these Terms will entitle any
          third party other than the Service Provider to anything.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          g. You may be protected by mandatory consumer protection laws and
          regulations, which guarantee you rights that no company’s terms can
          overrule. In that case, our liability is determined not just by these
          Terms, but also by any applicable consumer protection laws and
          regulations.
